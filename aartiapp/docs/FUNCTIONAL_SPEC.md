## 3. Business Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Bookmark ↔ Puja sync | Bookmarking an Aarti auto-adds it to the puja list. Unbookmarking removes it. |
| Aarti of the Day | Deterministic: `DateTime.now().weekday` → deity → first matching Aarti in catalog. |
| Recently played | Max 20 items, most recent first, duplicates removed on re-add. |
| Mantra counter presets | 11, 21, 27, 108, 1008 — user selects before starting. |
| Festival calendar | Pre-calculated dates for 2026–2028. Supports single-day and multi-day ranges. |
| Audio default | All aartis share a default audio URL if no specific URL is provided. |
| Puja session auto-play | Plays next Aarti automatically after current finishes (configurable crossfade). |
| Repeat mode | Loops current Aarti's audio indefinitely until toggled off. |
| Offline | All content is bundled — the app works fully offline. |

## 4. Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No aartis match deity + search + festival filter | Empty state shown with message |
| Audio URL unreachable | Fail silently — player shows but audio doesn't play |
| Festival calendar exhausted (after 2028) | Festival features degrade gracefully — no banner shown |
| User hasn't completed onboarding | Redirect to `OnboardingScreen` before `HomeShell` |
| Bookmark an already-bookmarked aarti | Toggles off — removes from bookmarks and puja list |
| Puja list empty | Empty state with CTA to discover aartis |
| Mantra counter at completion | Heavy haptic burst + visual feedback |
