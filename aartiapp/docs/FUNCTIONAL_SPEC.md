3. Section transitions use shell-level fade + slight upward motion.

### 2.1 First Launch (Onboarding)

1. User opens app → `OnboardingScreen` displayed.
2. **Step 1 — Welcome:** App title, description, "Begin" button.
3. **Step 2 — Name:** User enters their name (stored in `SettingsRepository`).
4. **Step 3 — Language:** User selects preferred script (Devanagari / English / Gujarati) and app language (English / Hindi / Gujarati).
5. **Step 4 — Notification:** User sets daily puja reminder time (optional).

7. Onboarding marked complete → `HomeShell` displayed with Home tab active.

### 2.2 Discover

2. User can search by title, deity, Devanagari text, or festival tags.
3. User can filter by deity chips (horizontal scroll) or festival tags.

### 2.3 Aarti Detail

1. User sees title, deity, and a script-aware subtitle when the selected script differs from the English title.
2. User toggles between Lyrics / Transliteration / Meaning views.
3. `Lyrics` always uses the global Script Language preference.
4. `Transliteration` is only shown when the selected Script Language does not already match the user's App Language reading script.
5. `Meaning` uses the app language translation surface, with English meaning as the fallback until localized Hindi/Gujarati meaning data exists.
6. User can:
   - **Bookmark** the Aarti (auto-adds to puja list).
   - **Add to Puja** directly.
   - **Play audio** via sticky bottom player.
   - **Enter Focus Mode** for distraction-free verse-by-verse reading.
   - **Open Mantra Counter** for Japa meditation.
   - **Share** lyrics as text or image.
7. Audio player shows progress, seek ±10s, repeat toggle.
8. When the current Aarti belongs to My Daily Puja and has a following item in that ordered sequence, a "Next" FAB appears at 90% audio progress or scroll-to-bottom.

## 3. Business Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Bookmark ↔ Puja sync | Bookmarking an Aarti auto-adds it to the puja list. Unbookmarking removes it. |
| Aarti detail next navigation | The detail-screen "Next" FAB is only available for Aartis that are currently in My Daily Puja and are not the final item in the puja order. |
| Aarti of the Day | Deterministic: `DateTime.now().weekday` → deity → first matching Aarti in catalog. |
| Recently played | Max 20 items, most recent first, duplicates removed on re-add. |
| Mantra counter presets | 11, 21, 27, 108, 1008 — user selects before starting. |
| Festival calendar | Pre-calculated dates for 2026–2028. Supports single-day and multi-day ranges. |
| Audio default | All aartis share a default audio URL if no specific URL is provided. |
| Puja session auto-play | Plays next Aarti automatically after current finishes (configurable crossfade). |
| Script language default | First-run script language defaults to Devanagari. |
| App language default | First-run app language defaults to English. |
| Transliteration visibility | Transliteration is hidden when the selected script already matches the user's app-language reading script. |
| Meaning fallback | English meanings are shown as the fallback until localized Hindi/Gujarati meaning data exists. |
| Focus Mode progression | Manual focus mode navigation advances and highlights one full verse at a time, not individual lines. |
| Repeat mode | Loops current Aarti's audio indefinitely until toggled off. |
| Offline | All content is bundled — the app works fully offline. |
| Theme-aware chrome | Settings controls, My Puja list controls, and Home recently played cards resolve neutral fills, borders, and captions from the current theme instead of fixed light-only tokens. |

| User hasn't completed onboarding | Redirect to `OnboardingScreen` before `HomeShell` |
| Bookmark an already-bookmarked aarti | Toggles off — removes from bookmarks and puja list |
| Puja list empty | Empty state with CTA to discover aartis |
| Mantra counter at completion | Heavy haptic burst + visual feedback |
